# PortalAR
Repo containing project that attempts to create the portals from the popular game Portal/2!

I'm using MRTK Scene Understanding to detect the walls/floors/ceilings. Important to uncheck auto updating in Windows Scene Understanding Observer
(Hierarchy>MixedRealityToolkit>Spatial Awareness>Windows Scene Understanding Observer Settings)

<br/> A Short Demo of Current Progress


Next Steps:
1) Add sound effects for any objects that go through the portal
2) Change the cube summon gesture; Use voice instead?
