# PortalAR
Repo containing project that attempts to create the portals from the popular game Portal/2!

I'm using MRTK Scene Understanding to detect the walls/floors/ceilings. Important to uncheck auto updating in Windows Scene Understanding Observer
(Hierarchy>MixedRealityToolkit>Spatial Awareness>Windows Scene Understanding Observer Settings)
